# Configuration for android build
Configuring your operating system to build android.
Installs the necessary packages and also installs some configurations to work properly.


## Usage

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfAURman/bash_scripts/main/setting_the_configuration.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x setting_the_configuration.sh
```

Then run it:

```sh
./setting_the_configuration.sh
```

After that, you will be asked a few questions during the installation. Your Github nickname, your email address, your user nickname (in the system) and the size of the cache that you want to allocate for the build.
